The Basemap

In order to build a Webmap with Folium we will need to first install Folium library as this is what we will use to build
our app.  What folium does is allows you write python code and then it converts it into javascript, html and css in
order to allow you to produce a webmap.

In order to install Folium:

sudo pip3 install Folium

In order to get a list of all available objects you can use with folium you can do:

>>>dir(folium)

you can then look for help on each object - for example:

>>>help(folium.Map)

So in order to create a map of London you can do the following:

>>> import folium
>>> map = folium.Map(location=[53.76,-2.70])
>>> type(map)
<class 'folium.folium.Map'>
>>> map.save("uk.html")

You can then open the webmap using your browser.  This will give you the base layer of your map to which you can start
adding layers to it to customize it.



Adding points to the map

Once we have our basemap we can add another layer on top to start adding points.  The following code allows us to add
a child to our map which will perform the layer adding to the base layer.  The code below allowed us to add a feature group
and then add a pointer from that:

import folium
map = folium.Map(location=[53.76,-2.70], zoom_start=6)

feature_group = folium.FeatureGroup(name="UK_football")
feature_group.add_child(folium.Marker(location=[53.46,-2.29], popup="Stadium", icon=folium.Icon(color='green')))
map.add_child(feature_group)

map.save("uk.html")



Add Multiple points

If you want to add multiple points you can use a for loop in order to loop through a list of lists of coordinates:

the code below has the coordinates for Old Trafford and Anfield.

for stadiums in [[53.46,-2.29],[53.43,-2.96]]:
    feature_group.add_child(folium.Marker(location=stadiums, popup="Stadium", icon=folium.Icon(color='green')))

The above method is ok if you a handful of items you want to loop from - however in real life you may want to loop through
hundreds of items so you will more than likely import these from a file and use pandas library.



Adding Multiple point from a file:

I downloaded a list of around 140 football stadiums and will use this to populate the points on my map which at the moment
only has Anfield and Old Trafford.  In order to organize and import the data into my python script I will use pandas.

I save the file as a csv in the same directory where my script is located and imported it into a dataframe via the
interactive shell:

>>> stadiums = pandas.read_csv("football_stadiums.csv")
>>> type(stadiums)
<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>

Now I need to incorporate the code above into my loop in order for folium to show my markers.
