OOP is a way to organize your code (it is also other things but for the time being lets think of it like that).  You can write python code without using OOP however once you start to write code that requires instantiation than methods\classes will work better than just standard functions.  It will also mean that you can keep your code DRY.  A general rule of thumb is that if you have more than 2 functions that apply parameters to the same object than you should be probably be using a class.
